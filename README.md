# Luketica Final Project
## Setup

In order to play the game you first need to run it on an https server because otherwise the module files will be blocked by the browser leading to the game not working at all.

You can do this in whatever way is easiest but for me I used the terminal to install an addon to node. It allowed vscode to run a https server when I inputed this code into the terminal while having the file open: **http-server -c-1**.

If index.html did not automatically open into the server browser, open it up first as it is the title screen.

## Gameplay

Next you can click *Burger Dynasty* in the center to reach the main game page. On this page you have several options for what you can do.

### Main Menu

The main menu button brings you back to index.html/\.

### Save/Load/Reset

**Save** downloads all the data in your game to the game into your storage.
**Load** takes the saved data and applies it back into the browser game.
**Reset** takes all the progress you have made and sets it to zero allowing you to start over again from scratch.

### Create Buttons

Click the create buttons to make that item, buttons that are grayed out cannot be clicked but can be unlocked to click with leveling up.

## Upgrades

The upgrades section allows you to make parts of your game go more quickly or efficiently as well as make progress. The cost refers to how many items of that type you require to buy the upgrade.

### Level Up Button

Increases your level by 1 up to 7 and unlocks the next tier of items and its button.

### Click Upgrade

Increases how many items get created per click.

### Autoclickers

Automatically create an item every four second, each additional upgrades increases how many items created.

### Achievements

Lastly achievements can be gained based on completing the requirements listed. Black means incomplete while purple means complete. One way to decide the game's end is if the player recieves *THE BURGER* achievement!
